        <p class="load load-text">There were many good memories which I don't want to forget ever. In 2009, I moved to
            the
            Czech Republic with my family for three years. It was a whole new world for me. From India to the Czech
            Republic was a huge jump. We lived in Prague. When I joined the International School of Prague, Nebušická I
            was in 5th grade. The students and teachers were so nice there. They helped me improve my English since my
            mother tongue was Hindi. I learned many things there. Learning in the International School of Prague was
            very fun and engaging. We did many exciting experiments in the lab, played many cool games in our PE class,
            and went to immensely fun field trips. Those three years went by so fast. We also did trips with our embassy
            folks to many places in Czech Republic. We went to Karlovy Vary, it is a town which is situated in western
            Bohemia. The town is truly gorgeous, it is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been to.
            After these exciting 3 years, we moved back to India in 2012. I cried a lot that day. I miss my friends,
            teachers and the locals of Praha.</p>

        <p class="load load-text2">Amazingly beautiful city and surroundings - The architecture of the city is gorgeous,
            even
            to this day when I walk home I spot something new. The old town is gorgeous, largest coherent castle complex
            in the world, the astronomical clock, The jewish quarter plus many more sites. The city is dripping in
            history from medieval, through the World Wars and through communism. It has a certain charm that not a lot
            of places have (if any). Also I feel it is the perfect size, not too big and not too small.</p>

        <p class="load load-text3">Prague, capital city of the Czech Republic, is bisected by the Vltava River.
            Nicknamed
            “the City of a Hundred Spires,” it's known for its Old Town Square, the heart of its historic core, with
            colorful baroque buildings, Gothic churches and the medieval Astronomical Clock, which gives an animated
            hourly show. Completed in 1402, pedestrian Charles Bridge is lined with statues of Catholic saints.
            <br>
            We hear the question, "What’s the next Prague?" a lot. But while we’re all for discovering great new
            destinations, we hardly think Prague is over. Sure, everyone’s heard of it, but it’s still a grand city with
            extraordinary historic and cultural sights, and it’s definitely worth a visit. The often-rebuilt Prague
            Castle has overlooked the city since the 9th century, and the synagogues and cemetery of the Jewish Quarter
            are must-sees. Nightlife here is diverse and plentiful, from trendy clubs to sophisticated wine bars to
            late-night cellar bars.
